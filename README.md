# Universal-Predictive-maintenance


Imagine a system that doesn’t just react to machine failures — it predicts them before they happen. This project is your plug-and-play solution for smarter maintenance, powered by machine learning and wrapped in a clean, interactive dashboard.

Whether you're dealing with factory equipment, HVAC systems, or real estate assets, this tool adapts to your data and gives you insights that matter — fast.

### 🧠 What It Does
- Trains a universal ML model that works across different machines and datasets
- Detects patterns and predicts failures before they occur
- Visualizes results in a Streamlit dashboard anyone can use — no coding required
- Saves models, scalers, and encoders for instant reuse

### 🛠️ Why It’s Different
- No tangled code — everything is modular and reusable
- Works with CSV, XLSX, and time-series inputs
- Built for real-world deployment and academic submission
- Designed to be understood by humans, not just machines

### 🚀 Who It’s For
- Engineers who want automation without complexity
- Analysts who need fast insights from messy data
- Students and researchers building scalable ML workflows
- Anyone tired of reactive maintenance and ready to go predictive

This isn’t just another ML project — it’s a future-proof maintenance brain that plugs into your workflow and starts delivering value from day one.
